The text is coherent (1). It asks about the process of enqueuing elements in a queue, which is a well-defined operation in data structures. The term ‚Äúenqueue‚Äù refers to adding an element to the back of a queue, following the First In First Out (FIFO) principle1. Here are the steps for enqueuing an element:
Check if the queue is full: Before adding an element, ensure that the queue has available space.
Increment the rear pointer: If the queue is not full, increment the rear pointer to point to the next empty space.
Add the data element: Place the new element in the location where the rear pointer is pointing.
By following these steps, you can successfully enqueue elements into a queue. üòä

The text is incoherent (0). The reason is that the term ‚Äúdequeue‚Äù specifically refers to removing an element from a queue, not a stack. In a stack, we use the term ‚Äúpop‚Äù to remove an element from the top. To dequeue elements from a queue, you can follow these steps:
Check if the queue is empty: Ensure that there are elements in the queue.
Remove the front element: Dequeue the element from the front (or head) of the queue.
However, for a stack, the process is different. To remove an element from a stack, you use the ‚Äúpop‚Äù operation, which removes the top element. The confusion arises because the term ‚Äúdequeue‚Äù is associated with queues, not stacks. üòä

For example, in C++, you can use the std::stack::push() function to insert an element at the top of the stack1. Similarly, in Java, the Stack.push(E element) method accomplishes the same2. The time complexity for pushing an element into a stack is O(1), and the auxiliary space required is also O(1). üòä 312

The text is coherent (1). It asks about how to push elements into a queue, which is a clear and relevant question. I‚Äôll provide an explanation on how to do that in C++ and JavaScript. üòä
In C++, you can use the queue::push() function to insert an element at the back of the queue. Here‚Äôs an example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(0);
    myqueue.push(1);
    myqueue.push(2);
    // Printing content of queue
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
    // Output: 0 1 2
    return 0;
}
The push() function adds an element to the back of the queue, increasing its size by 1. The time complexity for this operation is O(1) 1.
In JavaScript, you can create a queue using an array. To add an element to the back of the queue, you can use the push() method:
JavaScript
function Queue() {
    this.elements = [];
}
Queue.prototype.enqueue = function (e) {
    this.elements.push(e);
};
// Example usage
const myQueue = new Queue();
myQueue.enqueue(0);
myQueue.enqueue(1);
myQueue.enqueue(2);
console.log(myQueue.elements); // Output: [0, 1, 2]

In C++, you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) to work with stacks. Here‚Äôs how you can push and pop elements:
Pushing an element onto the stack:
Use the stack::push() function to insert an element at the top of the stack.
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    stack<int> mystack;
    mystack.push(0);
    mystack.push(1);
    mystack.push(2);

    while (!mystack.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << mystack.top();
        mystack.pop();
    }
    // Output: 2 1 0
    return 0;
}
The push() function adds an element to the top of the stack, increasing its size by 1 1.
Popping an element from the stack:
Use the stack::pop() function to remove the top element from the stack.
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    stack<int> mystack;
    mystack.push(1);
    mystack.push(2);
    mystack.push(3);
    mystack.pop(); // Removes the top element (3)
    mystack.pop(); // Removes the next top element (2)

    while (!mystack.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << mystack.top();
        mystack.pop();
    }
    // Output: 2 1
    return 0;
}
The pop() function removes the newest element (topmost) from the stack 1.
In Java, you can use the java.util.Stack class to work with stacks. Here‚Äôs a simplified example:
Java
import java.util.Stack;
public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<Integer> myStack = new Stack<>();
        myStack.push(0);
        myStack.push(1);
        myStack.push(2);

        while (!myStack.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.print(myStack.pop() + " ");
        }
        // Output: 2 1 0
    }
}

The push() function adds an element to the back of the queue, increasing its size by 1 1.
Popping an element from the queue:
Use the queue::pop() function to remove the front element from the queue.
Example:
#include <iostream>

    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(1);
    myqueue.push(2);

        cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
    // Output: 3

The pop() function removes the oldest element (frontmost) from the queue 1.

Result: <coherent(1)> Justification: The text inquires about pushing elements into a queue data structure, which is a coherent request. To achieve this, you can use the queue::push() function in C++. This built-in function inserts an element at the back of the queue, increasing its size by 1. The syntax is queue_name.push(value), where value represents the element to be inserted. For example, if you have an empty queue myqueue, you can push elements like this:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(6); // Adds 6 to the queue
    myqueue.push(0); // Adds 0 to the queue
    myqueue.push(1); // Adds 1 to the queue

    // Printing content of the queue
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
    // Output: 6 0 1
    return 0;
}
The time complexity of the queue::push() operation is O(1) 1. Remember that a queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, so elements are added at the back and removed from the front. If you need to remove elements from the queue, you can use the queue::pop() function 1. üòä

Result: <coherent(1)> Justification: The text is coherent. In the context of data structures, ‚Äúpush‚Äù and ‚Äúpop‚Äù operations specifically refer to actions performed on a stack. Here‚Äôs what they mean:
Push: When you push an item onto a stack, you add it to the top of the stack. This operation increases the stack‚Äôs size. The top element of the stack is the most recently added item. To push, you increment the stack pointer (often called ‚Äútop‚Äù) to the next empty position and then insert the new item12. For example, in C++, you might use myStack.push(value) to add an element value to the stack.
Pop: Popping removes the top-most item from the stack. It‚Äôs a way to retrieve and remove the most recently added element. You first extract the value at the top of the stack and then decrement the stack pointer. In C++, you‚Äôd use myStack.pop() to perform this operation1.
Remember that a stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last item pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off. These operations are fundamental for managing data in a stack data structure. üòä1

Push (Enqueue): To add an element to the back of a queue, you use the queue::push() function. This built-in function inserts an element at the end of the queue, increasing its size by 1. The syntax is queue_name.push(value), where value represents the element to be inserted. For example, in C++, you can push elements like this:

    // Printing content of the queue
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
    // Output: 6 0 1
    return 0;
}
The time complexity of the queue::push() operation is O(1) 1.
Pop (Dequeue): To remove an element from the front of the queue (the oldest element), you use the queue::pop() function. This operation follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. For example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(0);
    myqueue.push(1);

    myqueue.pop(); // Removes the next front element (1)

    // Printing content of the queue
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
    // Output: 2
    return 0;

The time complexity of the queue::pop() operation is also O(1) 1.

The text is coherent (1). It asks about the concept of a stack and how to push elements onto it. Let me explain:

A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Here are the key points:

Definition:
A stack is like a collection of plates stacked on top of each other. The last plate added is the first one to be removed.
It has two main functions:
Push: Adds data to the stack (similar to placing a new plate on top).
Pop: Accesses and removes the last inserted item (the top of the stack).
Push Operation:
To push an element onto the stack, follow these steps:
Choose the element you want to add.
Place it on top of the existing stack.
Update the stack‚Äôs top pointer to point to the newly added element.
Example:
Imagine you have an empty stack. You push three elements (A, B, and C) in sequence:
Stack:   C
         B
         A

Applications:
Stacks are used in various scenarios, such as function calls (call stack), expression evaluation, undo/redo functionality, and more.

The text is coherent (1). It asks about queues and how to push elements into them. Let me explain! üòä

A queue is a data structure that operates in a First In First Out (FIFO) arrangement. Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front). Here are the basic operations for a queue:

Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue1.
In C++, you can use the STL (Standard Template Library) to work with queues. Let‚Äôs focus on pushing elements into a queue:

queue::push() is an inbuilt function that inserts an element at the back of the queue. It belongs to the <queue> header file. The syntax is queue_name.push(value), where value is the element to be inserted. The queue‚Äôs size increases by 1 after pushing an element2. Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(0);
    myqueue.push(1);
    myqueue.push(2);

    // Printing content of queue
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
}
// Output: 0 1 2
The time complexity of queue::push() is O(1)2.
queue::pop() removes the oldest element (front) from the queue. It decreases the queue‚Äôs size by 1. The syntax is queue_name.pop(). Here‚Äôs an example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(0);
    myqueue.push(1);
    myqueue.push(2);

    myqueue.pop(); // Removes 0
    myqueue.pop(); // Removes 1

    // Printing content of queue
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
}
// Output: 2
The time complexity of queue::pop() is also O(1)2. Remember, the output reflects the FIFO property of the queue.
So, to push elements into a queue, use queue::push(), and to remove elements, use queue::pop(). üöÄ If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! üòä

The text is coherent (1). It asks about queues and how to enqueue elements into them. Let me explain! üòä

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. In other words, the first element inserted is the first to be removed. Imagine a queue of people waiting in line ‚Äì the person who arrives first gets served first.

Here are the basic operations for a queue:

Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue.
Dequeue (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front (start) of the queue1.
To enqueue an element into a queue, follow these steps:

Check if the queue is full: If the queue has reached its maximum capacity, return an overflow error.
Increment the rear pointer: Move the rear pointer to the next empty space in the queue.
Add the data element: Place the new element at the location where the rear pointer is pointing.
For example, in C++, you can use the queue::push() function to enqueue an element:

#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myQueue;
    myQueue.push(10); // Enqueue 10
    myQueue.push(20); // Enqueue 20

    // Printing content of the queue
    while (!myQueue.empty()) {
        cout << myQueue.front() << " "; // Print front element
        myQueue.pop(); // Dequeue
    }
    // Output: 10 20
}

Remember, the time complexity of queue::push() is O(1)1. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

The text is incoherent (0). It combines two different concepts: ‚Äústack‚Äù and ‚Äúenqueue.‚Äù Let‚Äôs clarify each of them:

Stack:
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. In a stack, elements are inserted and removed from one end called the top.
When you push an element onto the stack, it goes to the top. When you pop an element, it is removed from the top.
Think of a stack like a stack of plates ‚Äì you can only add or remove plates from the top.
Common operations on a stack:
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the top element.
Peek: View the top element without removing it.
Enqueue:
Enqueue is an operation used in queues, not stacks.
A queue follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
In a queue, you enqueue (add) elements to the rear and dequeue (remove) elements from the front.
To summarize:

The text is coherent (1). It correctly asks about queues and how to dequeue elements from them. Let‚Äôs dive into it! üòä

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. In other words, the first element inserted is the first to be removed. Imagine a queue of people waiting in line ‚Äì the person who arrives first gets served first.

Here are the key points about queues:

Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear (end) of the queue.
Dequeue (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front (start) of the queue1.
To dequeue an element from a queue:

Check if the queue is empty. If it is, return an underflow error (since there‚Äôs nothing to dequeue).
Remove the element from the front of the queue (the oldest element).
Update the front pointer to the next element in the queue.
In C++, you can use the queue::pop() function to dequeue an element:

#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myQueue;
    myQueue.push(10); // Enqueue 10
    myQueue.push(20); // Enqueue 20

    int frontElement = myQueue.front(); // Get the front element
    myQueue.pop(); // Dequeue (remove) the front element

    cout << "Dequeued element: " << frontElement << endl; // Output: Dequeued element: 10
}

Remember, the time complexity of queue::pop() is O(1)1. If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

The text is incoherent (0) because it combines two different concepts: ‚Äústack‚Äù and ‚Äúdequeue.‚Äù Let‚Äôs clarify each of them:

Stack:
A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
In a stack, elements are inserted and removed from the top.
Common operations on a stack:
Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Remove and return the top element.
Dequeue:
Dequeue (or dequeue) is an operation used in queues, not stacks.
A queue follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
In a queue, you dequeue elements from the front.
To summarize:

Stack: LIFO, push, pop.
Queue: FIFO, enqueue, dequeue.

#12
The text is coherent (1). It asks about the concept of a stack and how to pop an element from it. A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. Here‚Äôs how it works:

Stack Definition:
A stack is a collection of elements with two main operations:
Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removes the top element from the stack and returns it.
The newly added element becomes the new top.
Pop Operation:
To pop an element from a stack:
The top element is removed.
The element below the top becomes the new top.
Example in Java:
In Java, you can use the pop() method to remove and return the top element from a stack.
Example using java.util.Stack:
Java

Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();
stack.push("Welcome");
stack.push("To");
stack.push("Geeks");
System.out.println("Initial Stack: " + stack);
System.out.println("Popped element: " + stack.pop());
System.out.println("Stack after pop operation: " + stack);
C√≥digo gerado por IA. Examine e use com cuidado. Mais informa√ß√µes em perguntas frequentes.
Output:
Initial Stack: [Welcome, To, Geeks]
Popped element: Geeks
Stack after pop operation: [Welcome, To]

Other Languages:
Similar stack operations exist in other languages like C++ (using std::stack) and Python (using lists).
Remember, when popping an element, it‚Äôs essential to check if the stack is empty to avoid exceptions12. Stacks are commonly used for tasks like function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms. üòäüìö

The text is coherent (1). It asks about the concept of a queue and how to pop an element from it. Let‚Äôs dive into it:
Queue Definition:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
Think of it like a line where people join at the back and leave from the front.
Basic Operations:
Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
Dequeue (Delete): Removes and returns the element from the front of the queue.
Example in C++:
In C++, you can use the pop() method to remove the oldest element (front) from a queue.
Example using std::queue:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    std::queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(0);
    myqueue.push(1);
    myqueue.push(2);

    // Printing content of queue
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << ' ' << myqueue.front();
        myqueue.pop();
    }
    return 0;
}

Output: 0 1 2
Under the Hood:
A queue is often implemented using a linked list.
Enqueue adds a node to the end of the list, and dequeue retrieves the head (front) of the list.
Remember, popping an element from a queue removes the oldest one, maintaining the order in which elements were added. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è123

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle.
Elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).
Imagine a line where people join at the back and leave from the front.

To enqueue (insert) an element into a queue:
Add the new element to the rear (end) of the queue.
The newly added element becomes the last in line.
Example in C++:
In C++, you can use the push() method to enqueue an element into a queue.
Example using std::queue:

The text is coherent (1). It inquires about the concept of a stack and how to push an element onto it. Let‚Äôs dive into it:

Stack Definition:
A stack is a linear data structure based on the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
Elements are added and removed from the same end, known as the top of the stack.
Imagine a stack of plates: you can only add or remove plates from the top.
Push Operation:
To push (insert) an element onto a stack:
Place the new element on top of the existing stack.
The newly added element becomes the new top.
Example (Pseudo-Code):
Push(stack, x):
    Add x to the top of the stack

Under the Hood:
Stacks are commonly implemented using arrays or linked lists.
When you push an element, it becomes the top of the stack.
Remember, pushing maintains the order in which elements were added, ensuring that the most recently inserted element is accessible first! üìöüîº123

The text is coherent (1). It asks about the concept of a queue and how to push an element onto it. Let me explain! üòä

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It operates like a line where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front) 1. In other words, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

To push an element onto a queue, you can use the push() function. Here‚Äôs how it works in C++ using the Standard Template Library (STL):

Enqueue (Insert): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
The push() function inserts an element at the back of the queue.
Syntax: queue_name.push(value)
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(6); // Adds 6 to the queue
    myqueue.push(0); // Adds 0 to the queue
    myqueue.push(1); // Adds 1 to the queue
    // Queue content: 6, 0, 1
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << myqueue.front() << ' '; // Prints front element
        myqueue.pop(); // Removes front element
    }
    return 0;
}

Time Complexity: O(1) for the push() operation 2.
Dequeue (Remove): Removes an element from the front of the queue (the oldest element in the queue).
The pop() function removes the oldest element (front) from the queue.
Syntax: queue_name.pop()
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(0);
    myqueue.push(1);
    myqueue.push(2); // Queue becomes 0, 1, 2
    myqueue.pop(); // Removes 0
    myqueue.pop(); // Removes 1
    // Queue content: 2
    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << myqueue.front() << ' '; // Prints front element
        myqueue.pop(); // Removes front element
    }
    return 0;
}

Time Complexity: O(1) for the pop() operation 2.

The text you provided is coherent. The operations to push and pop elements in a stack are fundamental to stack data structures. Let me explain how they are implemented:

Push Operation:
The push() operation adds an element to the top of the stack.
In C++ STL, you can use the stack::push() function. It takes an element value as a parameter and inserts it at the top of the stack.
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    stack<int> mystack;
    mystack.push(0);
    mystack.push(1);
    mystack.push(2);

    while (!mystack.empty()) {
        cout << mystack.top() << ' ';
        mystack.pop();
    }
}
// Output: 2 1 0

Pop Operation:
The pop() operation removes the top element from the stack.
In C++ STL, you can use the stack::pop() function. It removes the newest (top) element.
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    stack<int> mystack;
    mystack.push(1);
    mystack.push(2);
    mystack.push(3);
    mystack.push(4);

    mystack.pop(); // Removes 4
    mystack.pop(); // Removes 3

    while (!mystack.empty()) {
        cout << mystack.top() << ' ';
        mystack.pop();
    }
}
// Output: 2 1

Note that both operations follow the LIFO (Last In First Out) property, meaning the most recently added element is the first to be removed123.
These operations are essential for managing data in a stack, whether you‚Äôre implementing it using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions! 

#17_pert_0
The text you provided is coherent. Let‚Äôs discuss how the operations to push and pop elements in a queue are implemented:

Push Operation:
The push() operation adds an element to the back (end) of the queue.
In C++ STL, you can use the queue::push() function. It takes an element value as a parameter and inserts it at the back of the queue.
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(6);
    myqueue.push(0);
    myqueue.push(1);

    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << myqueue.front() << ' ';
        myqueue.pop();
    }
}
// Output: 6 0 1

The push() operation maintains the FIFO (First In First Out) property of the queue1.
Pop Operation:
The pop() operation removes the front (oldest) element from the queue.
In C++ STL, you can use the queue::pop() function. It removes the front element.
Example:
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    queue<int> myqueue;
    myqueue.push(1);
    myqueue.push(2);
    myqueue.push(3);

    myqueue.pop(); // Removes 1
    myqueue.pop(); // Removes 2

    while (!myqueue.empty()) {
        cout << myqueue.front() << ' ';
        myqueue.pop();
    }
}
// Output: 3

The pop() operation maintains the FIFO order of removal1.
Both push and pop operations are essential for managing data in a queue. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! üòä

#18
The text you provided is coherent. Let‚Äôs discuss how the operations to enqueue and dequeue elements in a queue are implemented:

Enqueue Operation:
The enqueue() operation adds an element to the back (rear) of the queue.
To enqueue an element:
Check if the queue is full. If it is, return an overflow error.
If the queue is not full, increment the rear pointer to point to the next empty space.
Add the data element to the queue location where the rear is pointing.
Return success.
Enqueue representation in C++:
void queueEnqueue(int data) {
    if (capacity == rear) {
        printf("Queue is full");
        return;
    } else {
        queue[rear] = data;
        rear++;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(N)
Dequeue Operation:
The dequeue() operation removes and returns an element from the front of the queue.
To dequeue an element:
Check if the queue is empty. If it is, return an underflow error.
If the queue is not empty, access the data where the front is pointing.
Increment the front pointer to point to the next available data element.
Return success.
Dequeue representation in C++:
void queueDequeue() {
    if (front == rear) {
        printf("Queue is empty");
        return;
    } else {
        for (int i = 0; i < rear - 1; i++) {
            queue[i] = queue[i + 1];
        }
        rear--;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(N)
These operations are essential for managing data in a queue, whether implemented using arrays or linked lists.

#18_pert_0
The text you provided is incoherent. The operations to enqueue and dequeue elements are typically associated with queues, not stacks. Let‚Äôs clarify the correct implementations for both:

Enqueue Operation (for Queues):
The enqueue() operation adds an element to the back (rear) of the queue.
In a queue, you would use the enqueue() function to insert an element at the rear end.
Example (C++):
void enqueue(Queue& q, int data) {
    q.push(data); // Assuming 'q' is a queue
}

Complexity: O(1)
Dequeue Operation (for Queues):
The dequeue() operation removes and returns the front (oldest) element from the queue.
In a queue, you would use the dequeue() function to remove the front element.
Example (C++):
int dequeue(Queue& q) {
    int frontElement = q.front(); // Assuming 'q' is a queue
    q.pop();
    return frontElement;
}

Complexity: O(1)
Stacks, on the other hand, do not have enqueue and dequeue operations. Instead, they have push() (to add) and pop() (to remove) operations. If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! üòä

#19
Result: coherent (1)
Justification: The pop operation in a stack always occurs at the top of the stack. When an element is removed from the stack, it is taken from the topmost position. This behavior is consistent across various programming languages and implementations of stacks123. üòä

#19_pert_0
Result: coherent (1)
Justification: In a queue, the enqueue operation occurs at the rear end.
